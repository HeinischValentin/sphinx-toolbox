.. autotypeddict::
======================

.. rst:directive:: autotypeddict

	Directive to automatically document a :class:`typing.TypedDict`.

	The output is based on the :rst:dir:`autoclass` directive, but with a few differences:

	* Private and Special members are always excluded.
	* Undocumented members are always included.
	* The default sort order is ``bysource``.

	The following options are available:

	.. rst:directive:option:: noindex
		:type: flag

		Do not generate index entries for the documented object (and all autodocumented members).

	.. rst:directive:option:: alphabetical
		:type: flag

		Sort the keys alphabetically. By default the keys are listed in the order they were defined.

	See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html
	for further information.

	.. versionadded:: 0.5.0

	**Examples:**

	.. literalinclude:: ../../autotypeddict_demo.py
		:language: python
		:tab-width: 4
		:linenos:

	.. rest-example::

		.. automodule:: autotypeddict_demo
			:no-autosummary:
			:exclude-members: Movie

		.. autotypeddict:: autotypeddict_demo.Movie


.. rst:role:: typeddict

	Role that provides a cross-reference to the documentation generated by :rst:dir:`autotypeddict`.
