.. autoprotocol::
======================

.. rst:directive:: autoprotocol

	Directive to automatically document a :class:`typing.Protocol`.

	The output is based on the :rst:dir:`autoclass` directive, but with a few differences:

	* Private members are always excluded.
	* Special members (dunder methods) are always included.
	* Undocumented members are always included.

	The following options from :rst:dir:`autoclass` are available:

	.. rst:directive:option:: noindex
		:type: flag

		Do not generate index entries for the documented object (and all autodocumented members).

	.. rst:directive:option:: member-order
		:type: string

		Override the global value of ``autodoc_member_order`` for one directive.

	See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html
	for further information.

	**Examples:**

	.. literalinclude:: ../../autoprotocol_demo.py
		:language: python
		:tab-width: 4
		:linenos:

	.. rest-example::

		.. automodule:: autoprotocol_demo
			:members:
			:no-autosummary:
			:exclude-members: HasGreaterThan

		.. autoprotocol:: autoprotocol_demo.HasGreaterThan


.. rst:role:: protocol

	Role that provides a cross-reference to the documentation generated by :rst:dir:`autoprotocol`.
